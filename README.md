# Polish Blackjack (Oczko)

## Description
My project is a polish version of Blackjack called "Oczko". The goal is to achieve a score bigger than the opponent but less than 22.
Achieving exactly 21 points is an instant win. The game is a console application for two players in a local versus mode.

## Aim of the project
It is a task from the book "Computer programming in tasks - the C # language" by Anna Kempa. There wasn't a ready solution. 
I did the task completely by myself and believe this is the right project to extend my repository.

## Used technologies
Project is created with:
* C#

## Project status
* 1.0 version developed.
* Further improvements incoming.
